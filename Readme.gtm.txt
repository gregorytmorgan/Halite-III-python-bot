Notes
=========================================

Ship states and navigation
-----------------------------------------

Exploring
1. Exploring ships have two 'sub-states', 'navigating' and 'mining/searching'. Not implemented.

2. Performance, per the discussion linked below, 'inspiration' is expensive. You can
   test without it by using a custom config. 'halite-config.json'.
